#Forms
1. User enters some information.
2. The user presses the submit button.
3. The browser sends the information to a server.

To create a form, we can use the <form> element.
<form action="" method="">
    More code will go here!
</form>

Two attributes are commonly used with the <form> element:
    1. The "action" attribute that says where the form data should go after it is submitted.
    2. The "method" attribute for how the form daa is processed.

It is usually either sent somewhere esle via "post" or used with something else via "get".

# INPUTS

To enter the data, we use the <input> element as an interactive control for entering data.
A "type" attribute is used to determine the kind of input to use.
While there are many "type"s of inputs, the two we'll use most often are:

    1. A "text" value that renders a plain textbox on the form.
<form>
  <input type="text">
</form>
    
    2. A "submit" value that turns the <input> element into a button fpr submitting the form data.
<form>
  <input type="submit">
</form>

NOTE: The <input> element uses a self-closing tag.

By default, the text of the "submit" input type will say "Submit", but this can be changed by setting a value attribute for the <input> element:
<input type="submit" value="Submit Form!">
