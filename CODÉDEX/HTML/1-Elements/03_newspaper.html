There are six levels of headings, from <h1> to <h6>:
<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6>

Suppose we also want to add a new line within a paragraph element.
Pressing enter won't do us any good because HTML ignores multiple spaces and line breaks within elements.

So we must use the <br> break tag here!

The <br> break tag adds a line break:
<body>
  <h1>Breaking News</h1>
  <p>Florida man robs convenience store with an alligator.<br>Leaves a baby Crocs behind.</p>
</body>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A self-closing tag doesn't need to be closed manually by a closing tag... it does not have a separate closing </tag>. 
The break tag is the first one we have encountered.

<body>
   <h1>For First Time, Tests With Gene Therapy Begin</h1>
   <h4>Jan. 30, 1991</h4>
   <p>Two cancer patients yesterday became the first people to receive<br>
      gene therapy in an attempt to defeat otherwise incurable tumors.</p>
   <p>In a simple procedure that lasted barely 20 minutes, the patients, a<br>
      29-year-old woman and a 42-year-old man, were each infused with<br> 
      about 100 million white blood cells. The cells enfolded a genetically<br>
      engineered copy of a gene that makes a potent anti-cancer enzyme.</p>
