LINKS

Links are integral to the idea of the internet. They are how users connect to other sites and navigate the web.

So how do we add a link to our web page?

We can use the <a> anchor element! This link tag allows us to add a hyperlink to a piece of text.
<a href="https://archive.org/web">Internet Archive</a>

Here, the <a> anchor element is similar to other tags,
where the text inside is what is displayed. But what about the href inside the opening tag?

An href, or hyperlink reference, is a reference or pointer to another website that is linked in our HTML.
When the text “Internet Archive” is clicked, the HTML will redirect to that site.

Note: This can also be used to point to an email or phone number using a mailto:, tel:, or sms: parameter:

<a href="mailto:frankie@gmail.com">📧</a>
<a href="tel:212-555-2368">🤙</a>
<a href="sms:320-250-HTML">💬</a>

IMAGES
What if we want to add images? We can use a similar format, but with the <img> image element.
<p>Here's a cute pic:</p>
<img src="https://i.redd.it/5unn16axx1v81.jpg">

The <img> image element is another self-closing tag, so it doesn't have a closing tag.

src attribute, which stands for “source”, specifies the file path of the image.
"https://i.redd.it/5unn16axx1v81.jpg" is the image path.
For most images, the file path can be found by right-clicking on the image and selecting "Copy Image Address".
