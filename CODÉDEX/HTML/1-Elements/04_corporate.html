Here are some common ones:

<b> element to bold text.
<i> element to italicize text.
<u> element to underline text.
<s> element to strikethrough text.
------------------------------------------------
Note: The <b> element is just for bolding text stylistically; 
HTML also has a <strong> element used to convey that the content inside is important,
as well as styling it to be bold.
