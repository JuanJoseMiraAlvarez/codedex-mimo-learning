 # Attributes
 Additonal settings that we can use to customzize an element.
 Usually name/values pairs, like name="value"., where name is the attribute and value is the value of the attribute.
 They are used to provide additional information about an element. Separated by an equal sign.
 <element name="value">Content</element>
The name indicates the attribute we are setting for our element.
The "value" for our attribute is surrounded by " double quotes.

For example, by deafult, the <ol> element will create a numbered list.
But we can use the "type" attribute to change the type of numbering used.
<ol type="a">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>

Or, if we want to create a list with roman numerals, we can use the "type" attribute with the value "i".
<ol type="i">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
The "type" attribute is used to specify the type of numbering for the list items.

The "src" attribute is used to specify the source of the image.

And remember that width="250" attribute from the previous exercise? Yup! That was an attribute that sets the width of the image.

In addition to src, we can also use the alt attribute to make our images more accessible.

<img alt="pixel girl using a laptop" src="https://www.codedex.io/images/tier1.png">

If our image can't appear for some reason, the alt text is displayed instead! 
This allows assistive devices to read our text and describe the image.

## Attribute in Anchor Tag
The anchor tag <a> is used to create hyperlinks.
The href attribute is used to specify the URL of the page the link goes to.
<a href="https://www.codedex.io">Codedex</a>
The href attribute is where we add a URL that can be visited when the hyperlinked text is clicked.

We can also use the target attribute and set it to "_blank" to make the link open in a new browser tab:
<a href="https://www.codedex.io/" target="_blank">Codédex</a>
